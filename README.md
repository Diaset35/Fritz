# Fritz : a robotic puppet

Fritz is an animatronic puppet that is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. Fritz 
was created to provide an inexpensive introduction into robotics that is both entertaining, creative 
and educational. With an open source directive, Fritz is accompanied by a PC application to 
provide you with an easy to use interface in customizing and interacting with the project mechanics.
